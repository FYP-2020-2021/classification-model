space, the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on earth from a record-breaking mission.\n","it seemed like i lived there forever, kelly said.\n","he had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt.\n","maybe, occasionally, you do go bananas, he said.\n","kelly and a russian colleague, mikhail kornienko, spent nearly a year on the international space station (iss) in order to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight on humans.\n","nasa considers this research essential for a future mission to mars.\n","kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips.\n","kelly and his twin brother, mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests.\n","the tests will continue, to help nasa learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight.\n","he said the discomfort of returning to gravity took nothing from the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on earth.\n","when the russian capsule opened on to the cool air of kazakhstan, kelly said, he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area.\n","it was the fresh air mixed with the charred, kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere.\n","as he left the spacecraft, he said, the importance of the mission began to sink in: 340 days on a 15-year- old space station which is a million pounds, the size of a football  eld, the internal volume, some say, of a six-bedroom house.\n","the iss, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team.\n","there are things were going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we dont even know now, kelly said, comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at nasa in the 1960s and 1970s.\n","he added: the view is great, too.\n","kelly made the most of that view  he posted spectacular photos on social media of the earths cities, landscapes, oceans and atmosphere.\n","the earth is a beautiful planet, he said, describing the beautiful waters around the bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern himalayas.\n","he said he would like to visit that region, though he would  rst need to learn what country actually owns them.\n","but, mainly, you just notice how thin the atmosphere is, kelly added.\n","that, together with these large areas of pollution, is kind of alarming.\n","the astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution: smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the us, sections of asia with continuous, visible pollution nearly all year round.\n","he said the message we need to save the planet wasnt completely correct: the planet will get better; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment.\n","the worlds thin shield of atmosphere makes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down, he said.\n","its for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink.\n","and i do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to.\n","kelly was very active on social media, which made many people follow him online.\n","but he said he was unaware of it.\n","instead, he watched the drama of the 2016 us presidential election.\n","besides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: i tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next science experiment.\n","that made a difference to me  it kept my sanity.\n","being back on earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in, he added.\n","he recalled how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission.\n","ill soon start feeling that kind of culture shock, he said.\n","kelly predicted that he would not  y again with nasa.\n","but i dont think i would ever say im absolutely, 100%  nished, he added, because of the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as spacex.\n","they might need a guy like me someday, he said.\n","maybe, in the next 20 years, youll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.\n","--------------------------------------------------------\n","intermediate \n","\n","\n","do you want your child to be good at sport, play for the school team and, maybe one day, even compete in international competitions?\n","well, try to make sure that your future olympian or world cup winner is born in november or october.\n","a study by one of the uks leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are  tter than everyone else in their class.\n","november- and october-born children were  tter, stronger and more powerful than those born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays were in april or june.\n","dr gavin sandercock of essex university and colleagues found that autumn-born children had a clear physical advantage over their classmates.\n","the research involved 8,550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in essex.\n","all were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of  tness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power.\n","the results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.\n","november-born children were the  ttest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest.\n","those born in october were almost as  t, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with december children close behind.\n","the gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.\n","for example, we found that a boy born in november can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful than a child of the same age born in april.\n","this is, potentially, a huge physical advantage, said sandercock.\n","such gaps could decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance.\n","the study, which has been published in the international journal of sports medicine, found that, when scores for the three kinds of  tness were combined, those born in april were the least  t, then those in june.\n","that could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers, sandercock said.\n","the  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sport, too.\n","the results show that something other than the relative-age effect  the greater maturity of those born early in the school year  is the cause, especially as the  ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added.\n","the authors believe that autumn-born childrens greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin d is the most likely explanation.\n","seasonal differences in vitamin d concentrations in the womb seem most plausible, they say.\n","john steele, chief executive of the youth sport trust, said the quality of a young persons introduction to sport at school can be a major factor in their sporting development.\n","children that get a high-quality  rst experience are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said.\n","uk sport could not say if a disproportionate majority of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in november and october.\n","natalie dunman, its head of performance, said that while the differences highlighted in the new  ndings were borne out by teenagers competing in junior-level competitions, they had disappeared by the time sportspeople were taking part in adult competitions.\n","she said: with elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that make a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.\n","--------------------------------------------------------\n","intermediate \n","a girl born today in the uk can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78. they would have a longer life in andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but will live a little longer than in the us (81 and 76).\n","if they lived in the central african republic, they would die in middle age (49 and 44).\n","however, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as lesotho, which have experienced hiv and violence, lifespans are lengthening.\n","and the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago.\n","there has been a drop in deaths in under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.\n","this last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the institute of health metrics and evaluation (ihme) in seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global effects of disease.\n","knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive.\n","there are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all.\n","the project was a big task and is not without controversy.\n","ihme has been very radical in some of its methods.\n","where they did not have death registries or medical records, for instance, they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies  deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family.\n","the most surprising result has been the malaria figure.\n","ihme said 1.2 million die of the disease every year  twice as many as previously thought.\n","the big increase is in adult deaths.\n","it is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five.\n","the way i was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult, said dr christopher murray, ihme director.\n","we originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical, following the data.\n","african doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.\n","but, he adds, their fever could be something else.\n","the findings have led to further studies.\n","although margaret chan, director general of the world health organization, gave the ihme study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious.\n","we need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures], said colin mathers, a senior scientist.\n","we need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.\n","his colleague dr tiers boerma, director of one who department, added: people should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the who cant go with any academic publication that states a different number.\n","however, said mathers, ihme has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating.\n","one of the main themes, said murray, was incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be.\n","reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30. the change has been dramatic in latin america, for instance, where countries like brazil and paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. that is a 35-year increase in the average age of death over four decades.\n","in a place like brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it, murray said.\n","a second factor is the move outside africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer  some of which have significant genetic triggers.\n","that change has been particularly marked in latin america, the middle east and south-east and even south asia, he said.\n","the third big finding was, murray said, a surprise to us.\n","there is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives.\n","the main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you, he said.\n","they were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease.\n","in addition, there was substance abuse.\n","the numbers for these are not going down over time, he said.\n","we are making no progress in reducing these conditions.\n","--------------------------------------------------------\n","intermediate \n","emmanuel limal used online dating sites a lot but he was tired of meeting women who werent ready to start a family, or at least wouldnt admit that they were.\n","the 43-yearold actor, originally from france, had spent 20 years living in copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children.\n","he tried to find someone online but was dismayed by the results.\n","i got frustrated with everyone saying they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children, limal said.\n","on some sites, there was an option to click saying: id like kids someday, but you would read the persons profile and think: you will never have time!\n","if someones going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.\n","limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family  his father is one of 11  he has always wanted more children.\n","i couldnt seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family.\n","he said it was difficult to know when to mention wanting kids when he met someone new.\n","its the ultimate dating taboo, he said.\n","then one day i read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was really bad to admit but she wanted children.\n","and i just thought: you shouldnt be ashamed of this.\n","limal borrowed money to pay for the setting up of babyklar.nu  or baby-ready now in english.\n","it works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon.\n","we ask people if they are ok with someone who already has children and if they want another baby, limal said.\n","but we dont make them say how many children theyd like.\n","that would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online.\n","he has had a very positive response to the site.\n","we had 50 sign-ups an hour when we started in june and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together.\n","im fully expecting the first babyklar.nu baby by next summer.\n","more men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as its so lovely to be able to say this out loud and i finally dare to be honest about what i want.\n","the site has come at the right time for the country of five million people.\n","danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the copenhagen hospital rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain denmarks population.\n","the usual reasons are given  women are leaving it too late and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families.\n","now, i hope, men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another option, says limal.\n","he says that this isnt just about baby farming: i want this to be about children and love.\n","my goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner  and wholl stay together.\n","im a romantic at heart.\n","there are plans to launch the site in france and the uk later in 2013, but for now it is the danes who are benefitting from it.\n","danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the countrys so small, a jutlander can date a copenhagener without too much travel, limal said.\n","whats more, limal has finally found love.\n","ive met a nice woman and she wants a baby too  so we shall see.\n","--------------------------------------------------------\n","intermediate \n","valdevaqueros is one of the last unspoilt beaches in southern spain.\n","currently the beach just has an access road filled with camper vans from germany, france, italy and britain, which bring windsurfers and kitesurfers who are attracted by the strong winds in the area.\n","for years it has been very different from the concrete-lined beaches of torremolinos and marbella along the coast, but earlier in 2012 the local council in tarifa said yes to plans to build a tourist complex next to the beach.\n","environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species, but for most of the council the issue is simple: jobs.\n","tarifa has 18,000 inhabitants and 2,600 are unemployed as spain experiences its worst economic crisis in at least half a century.\n","traditional jobs such as fishing are dying out so tourism is the only solution, but it must be sustainable, said sebastin galindo, a councillor from the socialist party, which is in opposition in tarifa but voted with the governing peoples party support the project.\n","galindo says the complex meets environmental standards.\n","there is a law that was designed to stop more ugly developments like those that spoilt a lot of spains beaches when mass tourism first arrived in the 1960s and 1970s.\n","this law says that the complex must be at least 200 metres from the coast; it will be much farther than that  it will be 800 metres.\n","opponents of the complex say more housing is not needed in a country that already has a million empty homes.\n","the socialist opposition in madrid attacked the idea, and galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who came to spain during the boom years, many of them from morocco, whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from tarifa.\n","surfers fear that new buildings in valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local wind but fail to attract traditional package holidaymakers.\n","its not really a family spot.\n","just wait until they see what the wind is like, said henning mayer, who has come here from germany every year for 20 years.\n","ten years ago they said they would build a new highway here.\n","it didnt happen, so i think it will be impossible to build new hotels.\n","at the southernmost point of spain, tarifa is where africa and europe meet, where the mediterranean sea meets the atlantic.\n","campaigners say it also has a vital role for migrating animals.\n","the campaign to save the beach was launched hours after the tarifa council voted for the project.\n","the campaign has a facebook page and is supported by groups including greenpeace, the world wide fund for nature and the spanish branch of conservation network birdlife.\n","also joining the opposition to the project is the andalusian college of geographers, which says that the site would disturb two wildlife conservation areas and cross the border of a national park.\n","money is once again more important than urban laws and european environmental directives, said ral romeva, a member of the european parliament.\n","in romevas view, another problem with the project is that the site has too little water in a town that already suffers from shortages in the hot summer weather of andalusa.\n","many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away, and not on wasteland near tarifas picturesque old centre, with its typically andalusian white walls and small streets, dominated by a 10th-century moorish castle.\n","we agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town, but we are against it if it only benefits a few, said cristbal lobato, who has worked at the same beachside bar in tarifa for 30 years.\n","if they put it in the centre of tarifa, where there is space, then clients could visit shops, tapas bars and restaurants.\n","overlooking the green fields where the resort will be built, biologist aitor galn said, anywhere else in europe, this place would have the utmost protection, but here they want to get rid of it all and cover it with buildings.\n","what they want to do is turn this into benidorm, but what attracts people here is wildlife and the wind.\n","but by taking advantage of the current crisis and unemployment, builders and mayors who agree with them can justify any amount of destruction.\n","--------------------------------------------------------\n","Labels['Adv-Txt' 'Ele-Txt'
